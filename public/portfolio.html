This is because I changed my design 3 times in the last year and was never satisfied with it. In order to find out why I was not satisfied, I decided to compare the different versions and find out what I have done wrong so far. My goal this year was to create a portfolio that perfectly represents my person and that my favorite projects are well presented on my website for interested visitors.</p></section><section class="stages"><h3>The 3 stages</h3><p>I was already enthusiastic about minimalist designs. Less is more has always been one of my favorite sayings. However, you have to be careful not to use it incorrectly. I made exactly this mistake. As you can see in my first design, my portfolio consisted of exactly one page. The problem was that I didn't show anything about myself or even a little more information about my projects, even though that's exactly the point of a portfolio.</p><p>At some point I noticed that it is much more important to tell something about yourself and your projects so that interested companies / people get some impressions. Since I had to create a website as a university project, I took the opportunity and revised my portfolio for the first time. The result was a simple website with all the content that I found important for my portfolio. The problem was that I only let my own opinion flow into this design. Since I noticed that my second design has to many subpages, I quickly decided to discard this design and create a simpler design.</p><p>Since I was somehow still not satisfied with the second design, I decided to rework the design again. Now I have started to read some articles about design portfolios and case studies. In the end I understood what is really crucial for a good portfolio. To make all information as easy as possible to reach and to present only the most necessary informations, so visitors can easily find all information they need. Since I am a fan of minimalism, I chose the black and white design with a modern geomatric font. The illustration on the homepage should reflect my enthusiasm for drawing and design, much better than the standard illustrations I used in the designs before, because everybody uses that kind of illustrations in 2019. Since I only want to represent the most necessary, I decided to only provide my projects in detail and something about myself on my portfolio.</p></section><img class="project-image" src="img/portfoliostages.webp" alt="3 stages of my portfolio"><section class="learnings"><h3>Learnings</h3><p>Since I applied for my premium membership at Medium earlier this year, a lot has changed for me as a designer. I became more active, interested, motivated and I finally understood what makes a good designer. As a good designer, you really have to be interested in this topic, practice constantly and discuss with like-minded people. In order to get as many impressions as possible from other designers from all over the world, I started reading design blog posts. Since I read at least one article almost every day, I now feel that designers are a kind of family who are constantly motivated to try new things. For everyone who wants to work in this area later, I can only give you the advice to practice, talk about your projects with others and practice even more.</p></section></main><footer><nav><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanneswolfmayr/" target="_blank">linkedin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hnns_w" target="_blank">twitter</a> <a href="mailto:hello@hanneswolfmayr.com" target="_blank">email</a></nav></footer></div><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="main-min.js"></script></body></html>
