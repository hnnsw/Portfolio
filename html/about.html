            <h2>Hey! </h2>

            <p>For a couple of years I've been working intensively on UI/UX design. As standards change
                constantly in our world , I think that creating an interface between design and technology is
                indispensably important. I am always hungry to keep growing, learn new things, exploring the world
                and experiencing new adventures and challenges.
            </p>
            <p>You have a challenge for me or just want to talk about design-related topics?

            <h3>How did I become a UI/UX Designer?</h3>
            <p>Back in school, I implemented a large web project with a school colleague as a thesis. It
                quickly became clear to me how important user experience and interaction design are. We would have saved
                a lot of time if we had known more about this topic back then. Since then I have started to deal with
                UI/UX design more intensively. It soon became clear to me that my passion was in this area because I
                love that I can improve the world a little bit, just with my creativity. I had the chance with a bunch
                of others to design and implement a new software as a service solution for decentralized and predictive
                energy management to reduce costs and maintenance in buildings.</p>

            <h3>What's my mission?</h3>
            <p>As a creative, I want to take advantage of the infinite boundaries of design and make as many users as
                possible happy. I'm always open to work with like-minded people and learn from the best to
                improve my own knowledge.
