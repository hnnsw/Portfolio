            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>As a semester project, we had the task to concept a mobile prototype that would solve a sustainability
                problem.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="problem">
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>It is always rewarding to treat yourself to something new. But what happens to the things we replace? We
                collect more and more things and forget that some used items still work without problems and only our
                expectations have changed. In this way we are producing more and more “trash”, which consists of objects
                that may not be useful, beautiful or practical for us anymore.</p>

            <p>These useless things can gain a lot of value for us again, only we rarely know how we can do this or we
                are too lazy because it looks like too much work. However, this is rarely the case.</p>

            <p>This is exactly where we intervene and offer people ideas with our app to create new things out of old
                things. We provide contacts to repair broken things or donate unwanted things. Because for other people,
                these things can be still useful, something long-awaited or even an increase in the quality of life. For
                every kind of old device, as a refrigerator, bike, tablet, smartphone and many more, we offer a suitable
                section in our app. This thoughts form the three basic sections of our app: Upcycling, Repairing,
                Recycling</p>

        </section>
        <section class="personas">
            <h3>Personas</h3>
            <h4>Persona skeletons</h4>
            <p>As a first step, research and brainstorming in the team were used to find possible statements and
                problems from the target group. In order to get as real statements as possible, we also
                interviewed friends and relatives and searched for suitable studies on the Internet that
                represent and prove our problem.</p>

            <img class="project-image" src="img/personaskeletons.webp" alt="Persona Skeletons"/>

            <h4>Result (Personas)</h4>
            <p>Based on the persona skeletons we have formed 2 personas.
                The first persona has a constant urge for new technology and therefore has many unused devices.
                The second persona has a very high level of environmental awareness and tries to keep its carbon
                footprint as low as possible.</p>

        <section class="wireframing">
            <h3>Wireframing</h3>
            <p>After a bunch of user interviews and brainstorming sessions we made the first steps for the UI.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="prototyping">
            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
            <p>In total, the prototype went through three feedback loops in which potential users, study colleagues and
                professors evaluated the prototype.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="outcome">
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>We decided on a design that is already known to users. The mixture of map views and grid views should
                enable users to easily navigate through the app.
                The app is so colorful because the evaluations have shown that the separation of the sections is
                otherwise not clear and causes confusion.
                All in all, the idea and conception were very well received. There is a lot of interest, especially
                among younger users.</p>

            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>I am absolutely grateful that I got to know new techniques and tools in this project. I was able to
                expand my knowledge, particularly in the area of ​​user research, user interviews and prototyping. As I normally prefer
                Sketch and Figma as my number one prototyping tools, it was exciting to get an insight into Axure.</p>
